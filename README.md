# Price_Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the price of mobile phones using machine learning techniques. The aim is to develop a model that accurately estimates the price of a phone based on various features.

Datasets
The datasets used in this project was taken from Kaggle.

Model Development
The model development process involves several steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and transforming them as needed for model training.
Model Selection: Trying out different machine learning algorithms such as SVM, XGboost, random forests, to determine the best-performing model.
Model Training: Training the selected model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Accuracy, F1, Precision/Recall/
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model hyperparameters to improve performance.
Prediction: Using the trained model to make price predictions on the test dataset.
